# Dnd-Random-Char-Gen
# Description

This repository contains the files for our first group project for UT Bootcamp. This project was purposed to utilize all of the skills we have learned so far in html, css, and javascript combined with our knowledge of APIs to create a front-end, dynamic, web application. We also learned to work within the GitFlow by creating and resolving issues, managing a project board, making commits and feature branches and pull requests as a team. In addition, we used server side APIs to fetch data that the user can interact with and store onto local storage using javascript.

# How to Use

This is a random character generator for the role-playing game DnD (Dungeons & Dragons). Click the "Create" button and the input boxes will populate with a random name, race, class, and stats for you to use and save to the page! An image will also generate along with your character information.
